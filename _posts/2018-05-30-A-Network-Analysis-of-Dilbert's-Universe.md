For someone who grew up barely ever reading comic strips, I was immediately drawn to [Dilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert) the first time I saw it, and I take no shame in admitting that now I read it religiously every single day. 

The creator, [Scott Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams), has an uncanny knack for crafting the snarkiest jokes and razor-sharp punchlines that strongly resonate with whoever has had to put up with backstabbing bosses, toxic co-workers, clueless C-suite executives, dysfunctional corporate cultures, or dirty office politics.

As a long-time fanboy of Dilbert, I have always wanted to systematically analyze what really drives the action.

Therefore, this post will examine and visualize the network of relationships among the characters in Dilbert comic strips, which, in turn, may help illuminate the hilariously authentic office dynamics underpinning the strip's enduring appeal to millions of fans around the world.

More specifically, we are interested in answering these 2 questions:

1. ***What is the social network of Dilbert's universe like?***

2. ***Which characters are the most essential ones in the Dilbert network?***

The strips' full range of intricacies and sarcastic overtones are probably best experienced through reading them. However, by scraping, analyzing, and visualizing how the Dilbert comic strips throughout the past few years, we hope to present an interesting way of understanding the hidden social fabric that ties the characters together.
