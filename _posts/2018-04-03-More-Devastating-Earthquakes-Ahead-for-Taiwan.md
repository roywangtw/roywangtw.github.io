Located right on the junction between the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate, Taiwan is no stranger to big, devastating earthquakes. According to Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau, there have been 96 catastrophic earthquakes since 1900, rendering deadly tremors a permanent fixture in Taiwanese people's collective memory.

In fact, just this February, a magnitude 5.8 earthquake rocked Hualien in eastern Taiwan, along with several strong aftershocks, killing more than a dozen people and leaving dozens more trapped under crumbled buildings.
