I'm a financial spreadsheet junkie turned entrepreneur turned aspiring data scientist.

Please feel free to check out my [online resume](https://www.cakeresume.com/roywang) or [DataCamp profile](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/roywang).

After immersing myself in the wonderfully powerful R programming for around 2 months, I began to learn everything I could about data science, and have since become ever more fascinated by this evolving interdisciplinary field.

Thanks for taking the time to read my work!

I'd love to hear your feedbacks, so please [drop me a line](mailto:chuehchenw@gmail.com).
