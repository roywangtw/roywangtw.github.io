I work as a Data Analyst at Etsy with our search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. In summer 2016, I completed [Metis's](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science) three-month, full-time Data Science Bootcamp, where I did several data science projects, ranging from using random forests to predict [successful projects on DonorsChoose.org](https://github.com/robinsones/Predicting-Sucess-on-DonorsChoose) to building an application in R Shiny that [helps data science freelancers find their best-fit jobs](https://github.com/robinsones/Freelancer-Shiny-App). Before Metis, I graduated in June from INSEAD with a Master's degree in Management (specialization in Organizational Behavior). I also earned my bachelor's degree from Rice University in Decision Sciences, an interdisciplinary major I designed that focused on understanding how people behave and make decisions. 

I grew up in New York City, moved to Houston for college and then spent two years in Fontainebleau, France attending INSEAD. Because of INSEAD's two-campus system, I also lived for a few months in Singapore. I love all animals and consider myself part of the [#rcatladies](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rcatladies) despite not owning a cat. I do have a dog, Abby, who consistently surprises mountain hikers and Central Park joggers alike with her athletic ability.
