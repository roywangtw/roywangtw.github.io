I'm financial spreadsheet junkie turned entrepreneur turned aspiring data scientist. 

Please feel free to check out my [online resume](https://www.cakeresume.com/roywang) or [DataCamp profile](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/roywang).

I started learning everything about data science and R programming in early September 2017, and have since become ever more fascinated by the evolving field of data science.

Thanks for taking the time to read my work! 

I'd love to hear your feedbacks, so please [drop me a line](mailto:chuehchenw@gmail.com).
